Tried hosting app here https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/weatherapp-buildit/index.html
but no luck in getting to work.

Install


1. Clone repo
2. Open OS terminal
3. cd into Weather App
4. run npm install
5. Run npm start

App should open on localhost:3000 automatically

Given more time and more practice, I would of liked to have added more style and user experience into the fold.

Also to further to improve the weather app, a option to add a feature to search for weather by location and the weather change to that location can be implemented.

More detailed testing could of been done, using jest etc
